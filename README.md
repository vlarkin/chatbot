#### Install a pre commit hook script with gitleaks

Gitleaks is a SAST tool for detecting and preventing hardcoded secrets like passwords, api keys, and tokens in git repos. 
 
After cloning this repository to a local folder, navigate to that folder and run the following commands: 
```
cp .githooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod 0755 .git/hooks/pre-commit
git config --local gitleaks.enable "true"
```

The installed pre-commit hook script automatically installs 'gitleaks' tool if itâ€™s not already present on the system. 

You can disable Gitleaks in the pre-commit hook script with this command:
```
git config --local gitleaks.enable "false"
```

More details about the available git hook scripts can be found [here](/.githooks/README.md)
