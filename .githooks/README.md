# Using Gitleaks in a Pre-Commit Hook Script

Gitleaks is a SAST tool for detecting and preventing hardcoded secrets like passwords, api keys, and tokens in git repos.

## Installing a Pre-Commit Hook Script to Install and Run Gitleaks

After cloning this repository to a local folder, navigate to that folder and run the following commands: 
```
cp .githooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod 0755 .git/hooks/pre-commit
git config --local gitleaks.enable "true"
```

The installed pre-commit hook script automatically installs 'gitleaks' tool if itâ€™s not already present on the system.

## Verifying Gitleaks Installation

After installing the pre-commit hook script, try committing your changes:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Test commit"
```

## Disabling Gitleaks pre-commit checks 

You can disable Gitleaks in the pre-commit hook script with this command:
```
git config --local gitleaks.enable "false"
```
